summary: Baltimore Orioles
note: |
  The Baltimore Orioles are an American professional baseball team based in Baltimore,
  Maryland. The Orioles compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the
  American League East division. As one of the AL's original eight charter franchises
  when the league was established in 1901, this particular franchise spent its first
  year as a major league club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the Milwaukee Brewers
  before moving to St. Louis, Missouri to become the St. Louis Browns. After 52
  often-beleaguered years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in November
  1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney/civic
  activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. The team's current majority
  owner is lawyer Peter Angelos.

  The Orioles adopted their team name in honor
  of the official state bird of Maryland; it had also been used by several previous
  major and minor league baseball clubs in Baltimore, including the team that moved
  and was later renamed the New York Yankees. Nicknames for the team include the
  O's and the "Birds".

  The Orioles experienced their greatest success from
  1966 to 1983, when they made six World Series appearances, winning three of them
  (1966, 1970, 1983). This era saw the club feature several future Hall of Famers
  who would later be inducted representing the Orioles, such as third baseman Brooks
  Robinson, outfielder Frank Robinson, starting pitcher Jim Palmer, first baseman
  Eddie Murray, shortstop Cal Ripken, Jr., and manager Earl Weaver. The Orioles
  have won a total of nine division championships (1969-1971, 1973-1974,
  1979, 1983, 1997, 2014), six pennants (1966, 1969-1971, 1979, 1983), and
  three wild card berths (1996, 2012, 2016).

  After suffering a stretch of 14
  straight losing seasons from 1998 to 2011, the team has qualified for the postseason
  three times since 2012 under manager Buck Showalter, including a division title
  and advancement to the American League Championship Series for the first time
  in 17 years in 2014.

  The Orioles are also well-known for their influential
  ballpark, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, which opened in 1992 in downtown Baltimore.[2][3]

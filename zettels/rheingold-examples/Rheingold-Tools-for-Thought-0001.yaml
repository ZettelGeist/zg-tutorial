  When mass-production models of present prototypes reach our homes, offices, and schools, our lives are going to change dramatically.The first of these mind-amplifying machines will be descendants of the devices now known as personal computers, but they will resemble today's information processing technology no more than a television resembles a fifteenth-century printing press.
  They aren't available yet, but they will be here soon.
  Before today's first-graders graduate from high school, hundreds of millions of people around the world will join together to create new kinds of human communities, making use of a tool that a small number of thinkers and tinkerers dreamed into being over the past century.
  Nobody knows whether this will turn out to be the best or the worst thing the human race has done for itself, because the outcome of this empowerment will depend in large part on how we react to it and what we choose to do with it.
  The human mind is not going to be replaced by a machine, at least not in the foreseeable future, but there is little doubt that the worldwide availability of fantasy amplifiers, intellectual toolkits, and interactive electronic communities will change the way people think, learn, and communicate.
  It looks as if this latest technology-triggered transformation of society could have even more intense impact than the last time human thought was augmented, five hundred years ago, when the Western world learned to read.
  Less than a century after the invention of movable type, the literate community in Europe had grown from a privileged minority to a substantial portion of the population.
  People's lives changed radically and rapidly, not because of printing machinery, but because of what that invention made it possible for people to know.
  Books were just the vehicles by which the ideas escaped from the private libraries of the elite and circulated among the population.

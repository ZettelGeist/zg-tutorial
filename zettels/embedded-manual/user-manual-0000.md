In this example, I am showing you how to create a zettel that auto-generates a name (user-manual) followed by a counter that is maintained for zettels on the user manual.

```
zettel --file user-manual.md --prompt-document --id user-manual --name id counter --counter user-manual
```

This means I will be able to produce the new user manual from a collection of zettels.

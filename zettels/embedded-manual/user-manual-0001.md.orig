One thing that has changed (for the better) is that the counters are now stored in JSON format.

This file, `.counter.dat` was always used in the current directory to save the counter information.

You can now edit these counters (and even create new ones) at will.

here is what it looks like for our session:

```
{"user-manual": 0, "mosse-love": 0}
```

```
{
    "user-manual": 0,
    "mosse-love": 0
}
```

The above is what the JSON looks like when unraveled.

It clearly shows that we have two counters in this JSON dictionary. 

Users could change the counts, if there is a need to "start" at a certain number or to reset the counters.

By the way, this command was used to create this zettel:
```
zettel --file user-manual.md --prompt-document --id user-manual --name id counter --counter user-manual
```

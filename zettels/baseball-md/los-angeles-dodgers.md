The Los Angeles Dodgers are an American professional baseball team based in
Los Angeles, California. The Dodgers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a
member club of the National League (NL) West division. Established in 1883 in Brooklyn,
New York,[1][2] the team moved to Los Angeles before the 1958 season.[3] They played
for four seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before moving to their current
home of Dodger Stadium in 1962.

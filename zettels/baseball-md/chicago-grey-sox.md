The White Sox won the 1906 World Series with a defense-oriented team dubbed
'the Hitless Wonders', and the 1917 World Series led by Eddie Cicotte, Eddie Collins,
and Shoeless Joe Jackson. The 1919 World Series was marred by the Black Sox Scandal,
in which several members of the White Sox were accused of conspiring with gamblers
to fix games. In response, Major League Baseball's new Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain
Landis banned the players from Major League Baseball for life. In 1959, led by Early
Wynn, Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and manager Al Lopez, the White Sox won the American
League pennant. They won the AL pennant in 2005, and went on to win the World Series.

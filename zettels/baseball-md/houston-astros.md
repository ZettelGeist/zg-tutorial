The Houston Astros are an American professional baseball team based in Houston,
Texas. The Astros compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the
American League (AL) West division, having moved to the division in 2013 after
spending their first 51 seasons in the National League (NL).[2][3] The Astros
have played their home games at Minute Maid Park since 2000.[4] The Astros were
established as the Houston Colt .45s and entered the National League in 1962 with
the expansion New York Mets. The current name--reflecting Houston's role as
the control center of the U.S. space program--was adopted three years later,
when they moved into the Astrodome, the world's first domed sports stadium.

The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, commonly known as the Los Angeles Angels,
are an American professional baseball franchise based in Anaheim, California. The
Angels compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League
(AL) West division. The Angels have played home games at Angel Stadium since 1966.
The current Major League franchise was established as an expansion team in 1961
by Gene Autry, the team's first owner. The Angels name was taken by Autry in tribute
to the original Los Angeles Angels, a Minor League franchise in the Pacific Coast
League (PCL), which played in South Central Los Angeles from 1903 to 1957.

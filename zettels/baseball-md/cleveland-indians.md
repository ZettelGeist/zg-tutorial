The Cleveland Indians are an American professional baseball team based in Cleveland,
Ohio.  The Indians compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the
American League (AL) Central division. Since 1994, they have played at Progressive
Field and are the defending American League champions. The team''s spring training
facility is at Goodyear Ballpark in Goodyear, Arizona.[2] Since their establishment
as a major league franchise in 1901, the Indians have won two World Series championships:
in 1920 and 1948, along with eight Central Division titles and six American League
pennants. The Indians'' current World Series championship drought is the longest
active drought, and through 2016 is the fifth-longest in baseball history.

The St. Louis Cardinals are an American professional baseball team based in
St. Louis, Missouri. The Cardinals compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member
club of the National League (NL) Central division. Busch Stadium has been their
home ballpark since 2006. With origins as one of the early professional baseball
clubs in St. Louis, entrepreneur Chris von der Ahe purchased a barnstorming club
in 1881, then known as the Brown Stockings, and established them as charter members
of the American Association (AA) the following season. Upon the discontinuation
of the AA, St. Louis joined the NL in 1892; at that time, they were called the Browns
and the Perfectos before they were officially renamed as the Cardinals in 1900.
One of the most successful franchises in baseball history, the Cardinals have won
11 World Series championships, the second-most in Major League Baseball and most
in the National League. Their 19 National League pennants rank third in NL history.
In addition, St. Louis has won 13 division titles in the East and Central divisions.

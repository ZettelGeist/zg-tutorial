The Toronto Blue Jays are a Canadian professional baseball team based in Toronto,
Ontario. The Blue Jays compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of
the American League (AL) East division. The team plays its home games at the Rogers
Centre.  The ''Blue Jays'' name originates from the bird of the same name, and blue
is also the traditional colour of two of Toronto''s other professional sports teams:
the Maple Leafs (ice hockey) and the Argonauts (Canadian football).

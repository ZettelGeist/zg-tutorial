The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago,
Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of
the National League (NL) Central division, where they are the defending World
Series champions. The team plays its home games at Wrigley Field, located on the
city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the
other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League (AL) Central
division. The Cubs, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member
of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903.[2] The Cubs have appeared
in a total of eleven World Series. The 1906 Cubs won 116 games, finishing 116-
36 and posting a modern-era record winning percentage of .763, before losing the
World Series to the Chicago White Sox by four games to two. The Cubs won back-to-back
World Series championships in 1907 and 1908, becoming the first major league team
to play in three consecutive World Series, and the first to win it twice. Most
recently, the Cubs won the 2016 National League Championship Series and 2016 World
Series, which ended a 71-year National League pennant drought and a 108-year World
Series championship drought,"

The Philadelphia Phillies are an American professional baseball team based in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They are the oldest continuous, one-name, one-city franchise
in all of professional American sports, dating back to 1883.[6] The Phillies compete
in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) East
division. Since 2004, the team's home has been Citizens Bank Park, located in South
Philadelphia. The Phillies have won two World Series championships (against the
Kansas City Royals in 1980 and the Tampa Bay Rays in 2008) and seven National League
pennants, the first of which came in 1915.

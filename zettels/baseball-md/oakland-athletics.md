The Oakland Athletics (often abbreviated to A's) are an American professional
baseball team based in Oakland, California. The Athletics compete in Major League
Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West division. The
club plays its home games at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. The club
has won nine World Series championships, the third most of all current Major League
Baseball teams. The Athletics' 2017 season will be the team's 50th season in Oakland.
One of the American League's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in
Philadelphia, in 1901 as the Philadelphia Athletics. They won three World Series
championships from 1910 to 1913 and two in a row in 1929 and 1930. The team's
owner and manager for its first 50 years was Connie Mack and Hall of Fame players
included Chief Bender, Frank 'Home Run' Baker, Jimmie Foxx, and Lefty Grove.
